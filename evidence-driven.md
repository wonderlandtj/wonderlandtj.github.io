title: Evidence-driven Multidimensional Uncertainty Disentanglement
slug: /evidence-driven
pre_content: |
  By precisely disentangling multiple sources of uncertainty arising from data, conflict, models, and distributions, this work provides reliable quantitative measures for assessing whether a model “knows what it does not know,” enabling a critical transition from mere prediction to proactive risk awareness.
